# 2.22 - Incremental crawl of Sharepoint when sharepoint goes down in the middle of the process

##summary 

During an incremental crawl of Sharepoint, the Sharepoint farm becomes un-reachable for a long period of time. The crawl job should end gracefully after some time. Verify that no indexed documents are deleted as a result of the Sharepoint outage

## steps 1

  * Create list l1 in a site s1
  * Populate l1 with a few items
  * Configure datasource with "fetch failure allowance =1" to allow deletion from index on recrawl
  * Crawl s1 
  
## assertion 1 

  * Verify that l1 items were crawled and indexed

## steps 2

  * Edit list l1 and remove some list items
  * Crawl s1 using same datasource

## assertion 2

  * Verify that that deleted list items are removed from the corresponding indexed documents.
