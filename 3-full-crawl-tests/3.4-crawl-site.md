# 3.4 - crawl one or more sub-sites

##summary 

In this test we will crawl only one or more sub sites. Verify that we do not need to be a site collection administrator to do this as long as we list the site collections the sites are contained in.

## steps

  * Create subsites su1, su2, su3 in site collection s1 which does not require site collection admin rights to view
  * Crawl site collection s1 
  
## assertions

Verify that the subsites su1, su2, su3 and all their contents are crawled and indexed
