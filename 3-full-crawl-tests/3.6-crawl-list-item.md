# 3.6 - crawl one or more list items

##summary 

In this test we will crawl only one or more list items. Verify that we do not need to be a site collection administrator to do this as long as we list the site collections that contain the list of which we are fetching the list item for.

## steps

  * Create a list l1 in site collection s1 which does not require site collection admin rights to view
  * Populate list l1 with a few entries
  * Crawl s1 
  
## assertions

Verify that the l1 list and list items are crawled and indexed
